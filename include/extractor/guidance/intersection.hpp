// instructions themselves. An pososible example can be described like this:
//
// aaa(2)aa
//          a - bbbbb
// aaa(1)aa
//
// will not be perceived as a turn from (1) -> b, and as a U-turn from (1) -> (2).
// In addition, they can influence whether a turn is obvious or not. b->(2) would also be no
// turn-operation,
// but rather a name change.
//
// If this were a normal intersection with
//
// cccccccc
//            o  bbbbb
// aaaaaaaa
//
// We would perceive a->c as a sharp turn, a->b as a slight turn, and b->c as a slight turn.
