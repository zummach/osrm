        And the nodes
            | node | highway         |
            | x    | traffic_signals |

        When I route I should get
            | waypoints | turns         | route                 |
            | a,f       | depart,arrive | Hermannstr,Hermannstr |

        Given the node map
            |   | f |   |
            |   | e |   |
            | g |   | d |

            | r | x | s |
            |   | y |   |
