Feature: Bike - Accessability of different way types

    Background:
        Given the profile "bicycle"
        Given the shortcuts
            | key  | value        |
            | bike | 15 km/h ~20% |
            | foot | 5 km/h ~20%  |

    Scenario: Bike - Pushing bikes on pedestrian-only ways
        Then routability should be
            | highway    | oneway | forw | backw |

    Scenario: Bike - Pushing bikes against normal oneways
        Then routability should be

            | pedestrian | yes    | foot | foot  |

    Scenario: Bike - Pushing bikes against reverse oneways
        Then routability should be
