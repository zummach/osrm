Feature: Bicycle - Handle cycling

    Background:
        Given the profile "bicycle"

    Scenario: Bicycle - Use a ferry route
        Given the node map
            | a | b | c |   |   |
            |   |   | d |   |   |
            |   |   | e | f | g |

        And the ways
            | nodes | highway | bridge  | bicycle |
            | abc   | primary |         |         |
            | cde   |         | movable | yes     |
            | efg   | primary |         |         |

        When I route I should get
            | from | to | route           | modes                                  |

    Scenario: Bicycle - Properly handle durations
        Given the node map
            | a | b | c |   |   |
            |   |   | d |   |   |
            |   |   | e | f | g |

        And the ways
            | nodes | highway | bridge  | duration |

            | efg   | primary |         |          |

        When I route I should get
