Feature: Car - Handle driving

    Background:
        Given the profile "car"

    Scenario: Car - Use a ferry route
        Given the node map
            | a | b | c |   |   |
            |   |   | d |   |   |
            |   |   | e | f | g |

        And the ways
            | nodes | highway | bridge  | bicycle |
            | abc   | primary |         |         |
            | cde   |         | movable | yes     |
            | efg   | primary |         |         |

        When I route I should get
            | from | to | route           | modes                                  |

    Scenario: Car - Properly handle durations
        Given the node map
            | a | b | c |   |   |
            |   |   | d |   |   |
            |   |   | e | f | g |

        And the ways
            | nodes | highway | bridge  | duration |
            | abc   | primary |         |          |
            | cde   |         | movable | 00:05:00 |
            | efg   | primary |         |          |

        When I route I should get
            | from | to | route           | modes                                  | speed  |
