Feature: Traffic - turn penalties applied to turn onto which a phantom node snaps

    Background: Simple map with phantom nodes
        Given the node map
            |     | 1   |     | 2   |     | 3   |     |
            | a:1 |     | b:2 |     | c:3 |     | d:4 |
            |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
            |     |     | e:5 |     | f:6 |     | g:7 |
        And the ways
            | nodes | highway |
            | ab    | primary |
            | bc    | primary |
            | cd    | primary |

            | be    | primary |
            | cf    | primary |
            | dg    | primary |
        And the profile "testbot"
        # Since testbot doesn't have turn penalties, a penalty from file of 0 should produce a neutral effect
        And the extract extra arguments "--generate-edge-lookup"

    Scenario: Weighting based on turn penalty file, with an extreme negative value -- clamps and does not fail
        Given the turn penalty file
            """
            1,2,5,0,comment
            3,4,7,-20
            """
        And the contract extra arguments "--turn-penalty-file {penalties_file}"
        When I route I should get
            | from | to | route    | speed   | time    |
            | a    | e  | ab,be,be | 36 km/h | 40s +-1 |
            | 1    | e  | ab,be,be | 36 km/h | 30s +-1 |
            | b    | f  | bc,cf,cf | 36 km/h | 40s +-1 |
            | 2    | f  | bc,cf,cf | 36 km/h | 30s +-1 |
            | c    | g  | cd,dg,dg | 71 km/h | 20s +-1 |
            | 3    | g  | cd,dg,dg | 54 km/h | 20s +-1 |
