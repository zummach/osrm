## Environent Variables

### SIGNAL_PARENT_WHEN_READY

If the SIGNAL_PARENT_WHEN_READY environment variable is set osrm-routed will
send the USR1 signal to its parent when it will be running and waiting for
requests. This could be used to upgrade osrm-routed to a new binary on the fly
without any service downtime - no incoming requests will be lost.

### DISABLE_ACCESS_LOGGING

If the DISABLE_ACCESS_LOGGING environment variable is set osrm-routed will
**not** log any http requests to standard output. This can be useful in high
traffic setup.

## HTTP API

`osrm-routed` supports only `GET` requests of the form. If you your response size
exceeds the limits of a simple URL encoding, consider using our [NodeJS bindings](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/node-osrm)
or using the [C++ library directly](libosrm.md).

### Request

```
http://{server}/{service}/{version}/{profile}/{coordinates}[.{format}]?option=value&option=value
```

- `server`: location of the server. Example: `127.0.0.1:5000` (default)
- `service`: Name of the service to be used. Support are the following services:
  
    | Service     |           Description                                     |
    |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
    | [`route`](#service-route)     | fastest path between given coordinates                   |
    | [`nearest`](#service-nearest)   | returns the nearest street segment for a given coordinate |
    | [`table`](#service-table)     | computes distance tables for given coordinates            |
    | [`match`](#service-match)     | matches given coordinates to the road network             |
    | [`trip`](#service-trip)      | Compute the fastest round trip between given coordinates |
    | [`tile`](#service-tile)      | Return vector tiles containing debugging info             |
  
- `version`: Version of the protocol implemented by the service.
- `profile`: Mode of transportation, is determined by the profile that is used to prepare the data
- `coordinates`: String of format `{longitude},{latitude};{longitude},{latitude}[;{longitude},{latitude} ...]` or `polyline({polyline})`.
- `format`: Only `json` is supported at the moment. This parameter is optional and defaults to `json`.

Passing any `option=value` is optional. `polyline` follows Google's polyline format with precision 5 and can be generated using [this package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyline).
To pass parameters to each location some options support an array like encoding:

```
{option}={element};{element}[;{element} ... ]
```

The number of elements must match exactly the number of locations. If you don't want to pass a value but instead use the default you can pass an empty `element`.

Example: 2nd location use the default value for `option`:

```
{option}={element};;{element}
```

### StepManeuver

#### Properties

- `location`: A `[longitude, latitude]` pair describing the location of the turn.
- `bearing_before`: The clockwise angle from true north to the
  direction of travel immediately before the maneuver.
- `bearing_after`: The clockwise angle from true north to the
  direction of travel immediately after the maneuver.
- `type` A string indicating the type of maneuver. **new identifiers might be introduced without API change**
   Types  unknown to the client should be handled like the `turn` type, the existance of correct `modifier` values is guranteed.
  
  | `type`           | Description                                                  |
  |------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `turn`           | a basic turn into direction of the `modifier`                |
  | `new name`       | no turn is taken/possible, but the road name changes. The road can take a turn itself, following `modifier`.                  |
  | `depart`         | indicates the departure of the leg                           |
  | `arrive`         | indicates the destination of the leg                         |
  | `merge`          | merge onto a street (e.g. getting on the highway from a ramp, the `modifier specifies the direction of the merge`) |
  | `ramp`           | **Deprecated**. Replaced by `on_ramp` and `off_ramp`.        |
  | `on ramp`        | take a ramp to enter a highway (direction given my `modifier`) |
  | `off ramp`       | take a ramp to exit a highway (direction given my `modifier`)  |
  | `fork`           | take the left/right side at a fork depending on `modifier`   |
  | `end of road`    | road ends in a T intersection turn in direction of `modifier`|
  | `use lane`       | going straight on a specific lane                            |
  | `continue`       | Turn in direction of `modifier` to stay on the same road     |
  | `roundabout`     | traverse roundabout, has additional field `exit` with NR if the roundabout is left. `the modifier specifies the direction of entering the roundabout` |
  | `rotary`         | a larger version of a roundabout, can offer `rotary_name/rotary_pronunciation` in addition to the `exit` parameter.  |
  | `roundabout turn`| Describes a turn at a small roundabout that should be treated as normal turn. The `modifier` indicates the turn direciton. Example instruction: `At the roundabout turn left`. |
  | `notification`   | not an actual turn but a change in the driving conditions. For example the travel mode.  If the road takes a turn itself, the `modifier` describes the direction |

  Please note that even though there are `new name` and `notification` instructions, the `mode` and `name` can change
  between all instructions. They only offer a fallback in case nothing else is to report.

- `modifier` An optional `string` indicating the direction change of the maneuver.
  
  | `modifier`        | Description                               |
  |-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
  | `uturn`           | indicates  reversal of direction          |
  | `sharp right`     | a sharp right turn                        |
  | `right`           | a normal turn to the right                |
  | `slight right`    | a slight turn to the right                |
  | `straight`        | no relevant change in direction           |
  | `slight left`     | a slight turn to the left                 |
  | `left`            | a normal turn to the left                 |
  | `sharp left`      | a sharp turn to the left                  |
  
  The list of turns without a modifier is limited to: `depart/arrive`. If the source/target location is close enough to the `depart/arrive` location, no modifier will be given.
  
  The meaning depends on the `type` field.
  
  | `type`                 | Description                                                                                                               |
  |------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `turn`                 | `modifier` indicates the change in direction accomplished through the turn                                                |
  | `depart`/`arrive`      | `modifier` indicates the position of departure point and arrival point in relation to the current direction of travel      |
  
- `exit` An optional `integer` indicating number of the exit to take. The field exists for the following `type` field:
  
  | `type`                 | Description                                                                                                               |
  |------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `roundabout`           | Number of the roundabout exit to take. If exit is `undefined` the destination is on the roundabout.                       |
  | else                   | Indicates the number of intersections passed until the turn. Example instruction: `at the fourth intersection, turn left` |


New properties (potentially depending on `type`) may be introduced in the future without an API version change.

### Lane

A `Lane` represents a turn lane at the corresponding turn location.

#### Properties

- `indications`: a indication (e.g. marking on the road) specifying the turn lane. A road can have multiple indications (e.g. an arrow pointing straight and left). The indications are given in an array, each containing one of the following types. Further indications might be added on without an API version change.
  
  | `value`                | Description                                                                                                               |
  |------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `none`                 | No dedicated indication is shown.                                                                                         |
  | `uturn`                | An indication signaling the possibility to reverse (i.e. fully bend arrow).                                               |
  | `sharp right`          | An indication indicating a sharp right turn (i.e. strongly bend arrow).                                                   |
  | `right`                | An indication indicating a right turn (i.e. bend arrow).                                                                  |
  | `slight right`         | An indication indicating a slight right turn (i.e. slightly bend arrow).                                                  |
  | `straight`             | No dedicated indication is shown (i.e. straight arrow).                                                                   |
  | `slight left`          | An indication indicating a slight left turn (i.e. slightly bend arrow).                                                   |
  | `left`                 | An indication indicating a left turn (i.e. bend arrow).                                                                   |
  | `sharp left`           | An indication indicating a sharp left turn (i.e. strongly bend arrow).                                                    |
  
- `valid`: a boolean flag indicating whether the lane is a valid choice in the current maneuver

#### Example

```json
{
    "indications": ["left", "straight"],
    "valid": "false"
}
 ```

### Intersection

An intersection gives a full representation of any cross-way the path passes bay. For every step, the very first intersection (`intersections[0]`) corresponds to the
location of the StepManeuver. Further intersections are listed for every cross-way until the next turn instruction.

#### Properties

- `location`: A `[longitude, latitude]` pair describing the location of the turn.
- `bearings`: A list of bearing values (e.g. [0,90,180,270]) that are available at the intersection. The bearings describe all available roads at the intersection.
- `entry`: A list of entry flags, corresponding in a 1:1 relationship to the bearings. A value of `true` indicates that the respective road could be entered on a valid route.
  `false` indicates that the turn onto the respective road would violate a restriction.
- `in`: index into bearings/entry array. Used to calculate the bearing just before the turn. Namely, the clockwise angle from true north to the
  direction of travel immediately before the maneuver/passing the intersection. Bearings are given relative to the intersection. To get the bearing
  in the direction of driving, the bearing has to be rotated by a value of 180. The value is not supplied for `depart` maneuvers.
- `out`: index into the bearings/entry array. Used to extract the bearing just after the turn. Namely, The clockwise angle from true north to the
  direction of travel immediately after the maneuver/passing the intersection. The value is not supplied for `arrive` maneuvers.
- `lanes`: Array of `Lane` objects that denote the available turn lanes at the intersection. If no lane information is available for an intersection, the `lanes` property will not be present.

#### Example
```
{
    "location":[13.394718,52.543096],
    "in":0,
    "out":2,
    "bearings":[60,150,240,330],
    "entry":["false","true","true","true"]
    "lanes":{
        "indications": ["left", "straight"],
        "valid": "false"
    }
                                                                                                                               ]}
}
```

### Waypoint

Object used to describe waypoint on a route.

#### Properties

- `name` Name of the street the coordinate snapped to
- `location` Array that contains the `[longitude, latitude]` pair of the snapped coordinate
- `hint` Unique internal identifier of the segment (ephemeral, not constant over data updates)
   This can be used on subsequent request to significantly speed up the query and to connect multiple services.
   E.g. you can use the `hint` value obtained by the `nearest` query as `hint` values for `route` inputs.

## Service `tile`

This generates [Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/) that can be viewed with a vector-tile capable slippy-map viewer.  The tiles contain road geometries and metadata that can be used to examine the routing graph.  The tiles are generated directly from the data in-memory, so are in sync with actual routing results, and let you examine which roads are actually routable, and what weights they have applied.

### Request
```
http://{server}/tile/v1/{profile}/tile({x},{y},{zoom}).mvt
```

The `x`, `y`, and `zoom` values are the same as described at https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames, and are supported by vector tile viewers like [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/).

### Response

The response object is either a binary encoded blob with a `Content-Type` of `application/x-protobuf`, or a `404` error.  Note that OSRM is hard-coded to only return tiles from zoom level 12 and higher (to avoid accidentally returning extremely large vector tiles).

Vector tiles contain just a single layer named `speeds`.  Within that layer, features can have `speed` (int) and `is_small` (boolean) attributes.
